# Rechnen Für Erstklässler

This is [rust egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) remake of my old android application written in java that I have made for my kids
to learn simple maths for 1st grade scholl kids.

I have done the remake in [golang gioui](https://github.com/xdobry/rechnenfuererstklaessler/tree/main) and also in rust egui to learn and compare the 2 ui frameworks.
The results are in both positive.
The application are much shorter as andoid sdk java app and runs on multiple platforms (windows und webasm) without problems.
